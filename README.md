3. Log hours. During or after an event begins, users can log hours.
a. The default start and end dates/times are the event start and end dates/times. Users can change these to reflect when they were at the event. Currently, they have the flexibility to log hours outside of the event (ex. they showed up 30 minutes early or stayed 2 hours late).
